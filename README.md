Here's a simple Trivia quiz app made with Vite + react.js + Sass.
I fetched the Open Trivia DB API to recover Categories, Difficulty, Questions and Answers.

## BUGS TO BE FIXED ##
1. First screen: Easy Difficulty options is not selectable
2. Unable to apply the css class to color the background of the selected answer in red if it's wrong, or in green if it's right.
